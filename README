knowledge
---------

For lack of better title.

knowledge is a little experiment to create something slightly akin to 
a semantic database, which holds terms and their relationships to 
each other in a form that can then be used to describe those terms 
to the user.

So far, knowledge can recognise classifications (X is a kind of Y) 
and aliases (X is an alias for Y, meaning that all requests for 
information on X should be redirected to requests concerning Y).
Future plans include metadata (eg X has a "birth year" with value "1992", 
and "birth year" is a kind of "year" etc), associations (X is related to 
Y), and an actual point.

REQUIREMENTS:

python and a tty. A C version may be forthcoming.

USAGE:

See the interactive prompt, called by running python on knowledge.py.
